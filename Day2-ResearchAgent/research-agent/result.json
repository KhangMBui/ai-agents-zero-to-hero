  "prompt": "Research Agentic AI and summarize it.",
  "result": "Agentic AI refers to autonomous intelligent systems capable of acting independently, reasoning through multi-step problems, and adapting their actions in real time to achieve specific goals with minimal human supervision. These systems use self-contained agents that complete tasks and manage workflows using machine learning, algorithms, and predictive analytics for real-time decision-making. Agentic AI continuously learns and improves, making it distinct from rule-based automation. Its agents can communicate with other systems, automate processes, and tackle complex business challenges, making it a key solution in content creation, enterprise software orchestration, and other dynamic environments.",
