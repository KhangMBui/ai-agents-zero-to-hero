  "prompt": "Research Agentic AI and summarize it.",
  "result": "Agentic AI refers to intelligent systems that act autonomously, reason through multi-step problems, and adapt actions in real time to achieve goals with minimal human oversight. These self-contained agents use machine learning, algorithms, and predictive analytics to manage workflows and make decisions. Key features include autonomy, proactive behavior, continuous learning, real-time adaptation, and communication with other systems. Agentic AI improves and adapts over time, making it more flexible than traditional rule-based automation. Applications include machine learning, deep learning, language models, and orchestrating complex business processes.",
