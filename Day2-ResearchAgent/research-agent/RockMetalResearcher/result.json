  "prompt": "Tell me about the most dangerous band in the world (in rock music).",
  "result": "The title \"the most dangerous band in the world\" is most famously associated with **Guns N' Roses**. This nickname was frequently used in the late 1980s and early 1990s to describe the band's notorious behavior, unpredictability, and the raw energy of their music and live performances.\n\n### Key Context:\n\n- **Wild Lifestyle:** Guns N' Roses embodied the excesses of rock and roll with tales of substance abuse, run-ins with the law, and on-stage chaos. \n- **Unpredictable Shows:** Their concerts were sometimes marred by riots and Axl Rose's habit of walking off stage if something displeased him, adding to their dangerous reputation.\n- **Explosive Debut:** Their album *Appetite for Destruction* (1987) is one of the most impactful and bestselling debuts in rock history, featuring an aggressive sound and rebellious attitude.\n- **Controversial Lyrics:** The band courted controversy with their lyrics and album art, which often pushed the boundaries of what was considered acceptable at the time.\n\n### Legacy:\nTheir \"dangerous\" image was part of their appeal, setting them apart from more polished or corporate rock acts of their era. This reputation contributed to their mystique and enduring influence in rock music.\n\nOther bands sometimes given a \"dangerous\" reputation include The Rolling Stones in their early years, and punk acts like The Sex Pistols—but Guns N' Roses is the band most widely linked to that specific phrase.",
