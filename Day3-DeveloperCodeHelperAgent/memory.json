  "2025-11-20T06:54:03.689Z": "Removed the reference to an undefined variable (cdeg) in the add function. The function now correctly sums only its two parameters: return a + b;.",
  "2025-11-20T06:55:30.785Z": "Removed use of undeclared variable 'badVar' in the 'add' function and replaced undeclared variable 'z' with the correct parameter 'y' in the 'multiply' function.",
  "2025-11-20T07:10:58.789Z": "Multiple bug fixes in a TypeScript file: \n- Corrected a wrong import from a non-existent module to the correct Node.js 'fs' module.\n- Fixed a logical bug by changing addition to multiplication in a 'multiply' function.\n- Prevented a runtime error for a function called with missing argument by adding a default parameter value.\n- Removed a reference to an undefined variable in the 'add' function.\n- Added a missing return statement in the 'getNumber' function.",
  "2025-11-20T07:15:43.473Z": "Removed incorrect external import, fixed operator logic errors, replaced undefined variable usage, added missing return statements, removed TypeScript type annotations for JavaScript runtime compatibility, and replaced ES6 default parameters with ES5-compliant checks for robust execution in vanilla Node.js.",
  "2025-11-20T07:19:03.642Z": "- Fixed wrong import path ('fileSystem' to 'fs') then removed unused 'fs' import for runtime compatibility. - Fixed logic error in multiply (a + b to a * b). - Fixed missing argument in greet(). - Fixed reference error by removing use of undefined 'c' in add(). - Added missing return in getNumber(). - Cleaned possible invisible/hidden characters by fully regenerating the file. - Maintained correct TypeScript type annotations as long as runnable. - Converted to pure JavaScript for runtime check, with all print statements intact, but error appears external.",
  "2025-11-20T07:24:03.180Z": "- Corrected wrong import statement or removed unused imports.\n- Fixed logic error in multiply function (addition to multiplication).\n- Fixed greet function to use a default parameter, preventing runtime errors.\n- Removed reference to an undefined variable in add function.\n- Ensured missing return value in getNumber function is corrected.\n- Ensured all code is valid for a Node.js CommonJS context by removing ES module imports."
